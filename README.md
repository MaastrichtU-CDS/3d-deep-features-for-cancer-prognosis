# 3D Deep Features for Cancer Prognosis

The source codes for manuscript 'Using 3D Deep Features from CT scans for Cancer Prognosis using a Video Classification Model'

There are three main steps in our studies --(1) deep and radiomics features extraction, (2)feature selection, and (3)Cox proportional hazards models.

More specific for step (1)

More details about radiomics feature extraction can be found at the tutorial the pyradiomics https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For extracting 3D deep features from CT, we need to transfer ROI of CT to videos. You can find video generator at  to finish this part of job.
